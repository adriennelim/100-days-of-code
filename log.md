# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: September 18th, 2018
Language: Ruby

**Today's Progress**: Worked on refactoring ADA's Jump-Start exercise, 'Election Time'. Used arrays and hashes to handle additional votes and candidates better.

**Thoughts:** Initially struggled with getting back into coding with Ruby after a week of wrangling Python (Galvanize Fundamentals course).  Spent about an hour to go through some notes before starting on the exercise. It's getting a bit frustrating to load the file and manually test if code works after adding a new chunk or making corrections. Need to learn how to test properly!

### Day 2: September 19th, 2018
Language: Ruby

**Today's Progress**: Continue on refactoring ADA's Jump-Start exercise, 'Election Time'. Handle ties for a winner. 
Learned to use Git branch & build functions in Ruby - this is outside Jump-Start's curriculum which is great but I have a few bugs to resolved - mainly around "local variable not assigned".

**Thoughts:** 
Calling one function from another is great because I get to write and test codes in small chunks but tying them together is challenging.

### Day 2: September 20th, 2018
Language: Ruby

**Today's Progress**: Continue on refactoring ADA's Jump-Start exercise, 'Election Time'. Handle ties for a winner. 
Finally resolved the bugs and the infinity loop I accidentally created when I called the 'run_election' function again if there was a tie.

**Thoughts:** 
Should talk to some friends with coding knowledge and get their feedback on my code and also ask what their approach would've been if being asked to solve the same question.
