# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: September 18th, 2018
Language: Ruby

**Today's Progress**: Worked on refactoring ADA's Jump-Start exercise, 'Election Time'. Used arrays and hashes to handle additional votes and candidates better.

**Thoughts:** Initially struggled with getting back into coding with Ruby after a week of wrangling Python (Galvanize Fundamentals course).  Spent about an hour to go through some notes before starting on the exercise. It's getting a bit frustrating to load the file and manually test if code works after adding a new chunk or making corrections. Need to learn how to test properly!
