### Day 19,20: October 7-9th, 2018
`freeCodeCamp`

**Today's Progress**: Completed Product Landing Page project! Passed all fCC test suite checks.

**Thoughts:**
Further improvements to improve layout and alignment (especially the header) can be iplemented but I've decided to park it and move on to next project but will revisit from time to time. Another feature I want to implement is changing the 'select' button into something more useful -> allow user to add quantities of tea to a cart. Perhaps this is something I could work on after learning more JavaScript.

### Day 18: October 6th, 2018
`freeCodeCamp`

**Today's Progress**: Completed Survey Form project! Passed fCC test suite checks + made page responsive to width changes!

**Thoughts:**
Need to how to write code better and be mindful of names of classes. Spent quite some time renaming some classes especially when making page more responsive.

### Day 17: October 5th, 2018
`Ruby`

**Today's Progress**: Review Ruby, build palindrome word checker

**Thoughts:**
Spent a few hours reviewing basics and build some simple functions. Need to practice more often to improve knowledge retention as this is still relatively new.
Additional features: palindrome sentence checker - read up on gsub to remove punctuation & spaces

Focus on content first, then work on formatting later. Test on different screens if possible.<br>
Additional features: Check with fCC test suite. Make page more responsive with media queries & grids.

### Day 13: October 1st, 2018
`freeCodeCamp`

**Today's Progress**: Completed fCC's CSS Flex Box challenges.



### Day 8,9: September 25-26th, 2018
`freeCodeCamp`

**Today's Progress**: Completed fCC's Applied Visual Design challenges.

**Thoughts:**
fCC's challenges are really fun and interactive. However it gives me a false sense of competence. I need to take some time to revise through my notes and try to do some recall exercises to test my understanding.


### Day 7: September 24th, 2018
`Python`

**Today's Progress**: Built a command line tic-tac-toe game mainly with tuples, lists and some functions.

**Thoughts:**
I had previously attempted to build this game but hit some roadblocks so I am really happy for this to come together. I would like to work on this project again when I learn how to use Classes in Python.

### Day 4,5,6: September 21st - 23rd, 2018
`freeCodeCamp`

**Today's Progress**:
Reviewed/Redo fCC HTML & CSS (70 challenges in total)

**Thoughts:**
Previously completed fCC to JavaScript section but have not practiced while learning Python & Ruby, so I decided to spend time to redo most of the challenges.


### Day 3: September 20th, 2018
`Ruby`

**Today's Progress**: Continue on refactoring ADA's Jump-Start exercise, 'Election Time'. Handle ties for a winner.
Finally resolved the bugs and the infinity loop I accidentally created when I called the 'run_election' function again if there was a tie.

**Thoughts:**
Should talk to some friends with coding knowledge and get their feedback on my code and also ask what their approach would've been if being asked to solve the same question.

### Day 2: September 19th, 2018
`Ruby`

**Today's Progress**: Continue on refactoring ADA's Jump-Start exercise, 'Election Time'. Handle ties for a winner.
Learned to use Git branch & build functions in Ruby - this is outside Jump-Start's curriculum which is great but I have a few bugs to resolved - mainly around "local variable not assigned".

**Thoughts:**
Calling one function from another is great because I get to write and test codes in small chunks but tying them together is challenging.

### Day 1: September 18th, 2018
`Ruby`

**Today's Progress**: Worked on refactoring ADA's Jump-Start exercise, 'Election Time'. Used arrays and hashes to handle additional votes and candidates better.

**Thoughts:** Initially struggled with getting back into coding with Ruby after a week of wrangling Python (Galvanize Fundamentals course).  Spent about an hour to go through some notes before starting on the exercise. It's getting a bit frustrating to load the file and manually test if code works after adding a new chunk or making corrections. Need to learn how to test properly!
