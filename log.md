### Day 1: September 18th, 2018
`Ruby`

**Today's Progress**: Worked on refactoring ADA's Jump-Start exercise, 'Election Time'. Used arrays and hashes to handle additional votes and candidates better.

**Thoughts:** Initially struggled with getting back into coding with Ruby after a week of wrangling Python (Galvanize Fundamentals course).  Spent about an hour to go through some notes before starting on the exercise. It's getting a bit frustrating to load the file and manually test if code works after adding a new chunk or making corrections. Need to learn how to test properly!

### Day 2: September 19th, 2018
`Ruby`

**Today's Progress**: Continue on refactoring ADA's Jump-Start exercise, 'Election Time'. Handle ties for a winner. 
Learned to use Git branch & build functions in Ruby - this is outside Jump-Start's curriculum which is great but I have a few bugs to resolved - mainly around "local variable not assigned".

**Thoughts:** 
Calling one function from another is great because I get to write and test codes in small chunks but tying them together is challenging.

### Day 3: September 20th, 2018
`Ruby`

**Today's Progress**: Continue on refactoring ADA's Jump-Start exercise, 'Election Time'. Handle ties for a winner. 
Finally resolved the bugs and the infinity loop I accidentally created when I called the 'run_election' function again if there was a tie.

**Thoughts:** 
Should talk to some friends with coding knowledge and get their feedback on my code and also ask what their approach would've been if being asked to solve the same question.

### Day 4,5,6: September 21st - 23rd, 2018
`freeCodeCamp`

**Today's Progress**: 
Reviewed/Redo fCC HTML & CSS (70 challenges in total)

**Thoughts:** 
Previously completed fCC to JavaScript section but have not practiced while learning Python & Ruby, so I decided to spend time to redo most of the challenges. 

### Day 7: September 24th, 2018
`Python`

**Today's Progress**: Built a command line tic-tac-toe game mainly with tuples, lists and some functions.

**Thoughts:**
I had previously attempted to build this game but hit some roadblocks so I am really happy for this to come together. I would like to work on this project again when I learn how to use Classes in Python.

### Day 8,9: September 25-26th, 2018
`freeCodeCamp`

**Today's Progress**: Completed fCC's Applied Visual Design challenges.

**Thoughts:**
fCC's challenges are really fun and interactive. However it gives me a false sense of competence. I need to take some time to revise through my notes and try to do some recall exercises to test my understanding.

### Day 10, 11: September 27-28th, 2018
`freeCodeCamp`

**Today's Progress**: Completed fCC's Applied Accessibility challenges.

**Thoughts:**
I really appreciated the focus on increasing accessibility to include visually or hearing impaired users. It's definitely something I will keep in mind for my future designs.

### Day 12: September 29th, 2018
`freeCodeCamp`

**Today's Progress**: Completed fCC's Responsive Web Design Principles challenges.

**Thoughts:**
Be mindful about creating content for various viewports/ different screen sizes & devices. 

### Day 13: October 1st, 2018
`freeCodeCamp`

**Today's Progress**: Completed fCC's CSS Flex Box challenges.

### Day 14: October 2nd, 2018
`freeCodeCamp`

**Today's Progress**: Completed fCC's CSS Grid challenges and started working Tribute Page project

**Thoughts:**
Pretty daunting to write HTML + CSS codes from scratch!

### Day 15: October 3rd, 2018
`freeCodeCamp`

**Today's Progress**: Completed Tribute Page project! 

**Thoughts:**
Focus on content first, then work on formatting later. Test on different screens if possible.
